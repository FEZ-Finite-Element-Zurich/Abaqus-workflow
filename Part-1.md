# Step-by-step Instructions
## 1. Import a model

Before importing a model into Abaqus it is important to make sure your mesh is good quality. The better quality your surface mesh is in Avizo (or whatever meshing software you use â€“ Hypermesh, Mimics, 3Matic, Blender etc.), the better quality the tetrahedral mesh will be (for producing a high-quality mesh in Avizo, see my Avizo protocol). If the mesh has errors, such as high aspect ratio triangles, it may not run in Abaqus, which means you will have to start all over again and produce a better mesh. Get it right the first time and never look back!

Abaqus can import many file types; I have only used an Abaqus Input file (*.inp) and NASTRAN, exported from Avizo. Importing a *.inp model from Avizo or Hypermesh will set up a Part and an Instance for the Assembly. If you have multiple materials in your mesh that you want to apply different material properties to in Abaqus, it is better to save it as a NASTRAN file, because this will set up different sets, sections and materials when you import it to Abaqus.

File > Import > Model, select file type Abaqus Input File (*.inp) or NASTRAN Bulk file (*.bdf, *.dat, *.nastran etc.) and import the model.
