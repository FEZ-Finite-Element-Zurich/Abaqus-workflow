# Abaqus-workflow
A general Abaqus workflow for static analysis.

This is a step-by-step protocol to set up a simple, static loading scenario including how to assign material properties, boundary conditions (constraints and loads) and run jobs. There are various ways to set constraints (e.g. single nodes, coupling constraints etc.) and loads, and this protocol provides a couple of examples but by no means is exhaustive and Iâ€™m sure there are many other ways to do it! But hopefully this will help you get started. There are also different types of loading scenarios, such as thermal expansion, which are not described here.
